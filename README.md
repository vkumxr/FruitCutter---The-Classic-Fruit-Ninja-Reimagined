<h1 align="center">🍉 FruitCutter – The Classic Fruit Ninja, Reimagined</h1>

**FruitCutter** is a faithful yet imaginative remake of the iconic mobile game **Fruit Ninja**, built entirely using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). It is a **work-in-progress** game that brings slicing satisfaction to the desktop in a browser-based, visually programmed format. This project is part of my journey into **game development, visual logic, and interactive design** using the Scratch platform.

## 🎮 What is FruitCutter?

Fruit-Cutter is a Scratch-based game where fruits spawn randomly on the screen, and the player uses the **mouse pointer as a virtual blade** to slice them. The gameplay captures the essence of Fruit Ninja – fast-paced, reflex-driven action – but with the simplicity and charm of Scratch’s block-based programming.

Though the game is still under development, it already includes **core mechanics** such as:

- Sprite cloning for multiple fruit objects  
- Randomized fruit spawning  
- Mouse-tracking slicing action  
- Scoring system  
- Game Over condition when too many fruits are missed

This game is designed with interactivity and learning in mind, emphasizing Scratch’s ability to simulate real-time gaming experiences.

## ✨ Features

- 🥭 **Sprite Cloning:** Multiple fruits appear on the screen using Scratch’s clone blocks, each behaving as an independent game object.
- 🍌 **Random Fruit Spawning:** Fruits are spawned at randomized positions and velocities, simulating unpredictability and excitement.
- 🖱️ **Mouse-based Slicing:** Players "cut" fruits by dragging the mouse across them. Collision detection between the cursor and fruit determines a slice.
- 📈 **Score Counter:** Every successfully sliced fruit increases the player’s score.
- 💥 **Game Over Mechanic:** Missing too many fruits results in a game over screen, encouraging focus and speed.
- 🎨 **Visual Feedback:** Exploding animations and sound effects enhance gameplay immersion (under development).

## 🧠 What I Learned

Developing Fruit-Cutter has been a rich learning experience. Here are some key skills and concepts I explored:

### 🔄 Game Logic and Mechanics
- Structuring gameplay loops using `forever`, `if`, and `broadcast` blocks
- Managing states such as play, score update, and game over

### 👾 Sprite Cloning and Management
- Dynamically generating multiple fruit instances with unique properties
- Handling clone deletion and memory management within Scratch

### 🎯 Collision Detection
- Implementing accurate collision between fast-moving sprites and the mouse
- Triggering slice events and visual responses

### 🎮 User Interaction
- Designing intuitive controls using mouse input
- Giving users real-time feedback through effects and sounds

### 🧪 Iterative Development
- Repeatedly testing and refining game mechanics
- Balancing spawn rate, movement, and difficulty

### 🎨 Design & UX
- Making the interface visually appealing
- Designing simple yet effective fruit assets
